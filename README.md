The purpose of this assignment was to use R and Python to create linear regression models using a dataset modeling based on Salary based on Years of Experience. 
The tools for R that I used were ggplot2. 
The tools I used in Python were pandas, matplotlib, and the scikit learn linear regression model. 
My R-squared value for my graph made with Python was 0.785. The R-squared value for my graphs made with R was 0.7852. 

In part 2 I exported each notebook as a script and modified them to accept arguments. I then ran the scripts from the terminal to get png files of the graphs. To run the scripts, I put the command in the command line and pressed enter. 

The purpose of assignment 3 was to play with version control in GitHub. I cloned my Assignment 2 repo, created a branch, made changes to my original Assignment 2 work, and merged the branch back to the original assignment.
