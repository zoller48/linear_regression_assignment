The purpose of this assignment was to use R and Python to create linear regression models using a dataset modeling based on Salary based on Years of Experience. 
The tools for R that I used were ggplot2. 
The tools I used in Python were pandas, matplotlib, and the scikit learn linear regression model. 
My R-squared value for my graph made with Python was 0.785. The R-squared value for my graphs made with R was 0.7852.
